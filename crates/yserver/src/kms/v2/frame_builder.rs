//! Stage 5 frame-builder Phase B sub-phase B.1: deferred per-frame
//! op-list recording.
//!
//! `FrameBuilder` owns a `Closed ↔ OpenForPaint` lifecycle. Paint
//! entry points that have been ported (`composite_glyphs` in B.1)
//! append `RecordedOp`s; a close trigger (Invariant M2 / M3, the
//! existing `get_image` / PRESENT-completion sync points, a timeout,
//! shutdown, or a pin-set ceiling) replays the op list as ONE primary
//! command buffer, submits it via the `SubmitGroup` (cap=1, so the
//! submit auto-flushes immediately), and parks the frame's resource
//! pins on a `pending_frames` queue gated by the submit's
//! `FenceTicket`.
//!
//! Phase B spec — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-24-frame-builder-phase-b-design.md`.
//! This file holds the no-Vk-required pieces (state machine, op enum,
//! pin sets, layout overlay); the recording side lives in
//! `engine.rs::FrameBuilder::close_into_cb_*` because it needs the
//! engine's CB pool + atlas + drawable-store access.
