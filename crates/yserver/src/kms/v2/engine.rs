//! `RenderEngine` — drawing primitives into [`DrawableStore`] storage.
//!
//! Stage 2c lands the three single-drawable paint ops the v2 model
//! needs for offscreen pixel-correctness gates:
//! [`fill_rect`](RenderEngine::fill_rect),
//! [`put_image`](RenderEngine::put_image),
//! [`get_image`](RenderEngine::get_image). Each op is a self-
//! contained `vkQueueSubmit2` against a fresh [`FenceTicket`] from
//! [`PlatformBackend`]. The ticket is recorded on every drawable
//! the op touched (cross-cutting §5) so a later compose-read can
//! see the in-flight write; and parked on
//! [`RenderEngine::submitted`] for retirement via
//! [`poll_retired`](RenderEngine::poll_retired).
//!
//! What's deliberately NOT in 2c (per the Stage 2 plan):
//!
//! - `copy_area` (joins 2d alongside scene/blit).
//! - RENDER / glyphs / text / poly_line / poly_segment / etc.
//!   Logged-gap on `KmsBackendV2` until Stage 3.
//! - Per-op batching across multiple ops. 2c uses one
//!   submission per Backend method call — equivalent perf-wise to
//!   v1's per-op shape; submit-aggregation arrives in Stage 5.
//! - `vkQueueWaitIdle` anywhere. Only `get_image` waits on its own
//!   `FenceTicket` (off the hot path; sync RPC by protocol design).
//! - GC `function != GXcopy` and non-zero `planemask`. Stage 2 plan
//!   §"What doesn't ship in Stage 2": v2 logs a gap + drops the op.
//!   These come back in Stage 3 alongside RENDER.
//!
//! Layout discipline: every paint op brackets its work with two
//! [`Drawable::record_layout_transition`] calls so the storage is
//! returned to `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` for the next consumer
//! (compose-read in 2d, another paint op in 2c).

/// x8r8g8b8) must yield samples with `α = 1.0` regardless of the

/// pixmaps as `B8G8R8A8_UNORM` with the α byte as server-owned
/// padding — without this override, marco/compositing samples the
/// padding byte (often 0) and the operator collapses to no-op,
/// leaving widget windows invisible under a compositing WM.
///
/// ## Gate: `depth == 24` BGRA storage only
///
/// Stage 4d landed this as `depth == 24` rather than the broader
/// `depth < 32` because depth-8 (A8 alpha-only pictures) and
/// depth-1 (bitmap masks) carry meaningful α in the X11 Render
/// `PictFormat` — forcing `α = 1.0` on a depth-8 mask would
/// silently turn coverage masks into solid blocks. Picture-
/// format-driven resolution (looking up the actual `PictFormat`
/// attached to the source picture rather than the drawable
/// depth) is the cleaner long-term shape; `depth == 24` is the
/// load-bearing case marco-with-compositing depends on, so we
/// fix that first and broaden later if a non-depth-24 picture
/// format with `alpha_mask == 0` shows up in a real workload.
///
/// `Solid` carries its own α, `Gradient` LUTs are authored with
/// the right α from `RenderCreateGradient`, and `None` is the

///   (render.rs:~377). Returning the same constant keeps the adapter
///   honest about the layout the image IS in between open and close.
/// - `set_current_layout` is a NO-OP. The recorder's close transition
