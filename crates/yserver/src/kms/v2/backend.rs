//! `KmsBackendV2` — Stage 1b skeleton sibling of `KmsBackend` (v1).
//!
//! Per rendering-model-v2 spec § Stage 1b. Embeds the same
//! `KmsCore` as v1 so protocol bookkeeping (XID maps, window
//! metadata stripped of storage, fonts, SHAPE regions, etc.) lives
//! exactly once. Every paint / scene / RENDER trait method stubs
//! with a once-per-method `warn!` + `Ok(())`. Real components
//! (`PlatformBackend`, `DrawableStore`, `RenderEngine`,
//! `SceneCompositor`) land in Stage 2.
//!
//! The acceptance gate is **synthetic**: with
//! `YSERVER_RENDER_MODEL=v2`, the server boots, opens a connection,
//! services capability queries / atom queries / GetGeometry on
//! root; the first paint op produces exactly one
//! `v2: <method> not yet implemented` warn line per opcode. No
//! real-app gates land at this stage — those wait for Stage 3.
