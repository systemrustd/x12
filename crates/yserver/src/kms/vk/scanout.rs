//! Per-bo state machine + Vulkan-first scanout-bo allocation
//! (sub-phase 4.1.2).
//!
//! Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-phase4-1-vulkan-compositor-design.md
//! §"Per-buffer release fence" — table of transitions and fence-handle
//! ownership rules.
//!
//! ## Allocation direction
//!
//! Vulkan-first: each [`ScanoutBo`] owns a dma-buf-exportable
//! `VkImage`. The preferred path allocates it with an explicit DRM
//! format modifier from the KMS primary plane / Vulkan intersection;
//! fallback paths keep the historical `VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR` image.
//! The memory is exported as a dma-buf via `vkGetMemoryFdKHR`, the
//! dma-buf is imported into the DRM device via `PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE`,
//! and the resulting GEM handle is registered as a DRM framebuffer
//! with `add_fb2`.
//!
//! Why Vulkan-first instead of GBM-first:
//! - Works on RADV gfx8/Polaris (no `VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier`
//!   needed; linear images don't need a modifier handle to communicate
//!   to KMS).
//! - Works through Mesa Venus (host-allocated memory wrapped as a
//!   virtgpu blob → guest dma-buf → guest virtio-gpu DRM. Same
//!   direction Mesa+Wayland use; the reverse direction
//!   `vkGetMemoryResourcePropertiesMESA`'d on a guest GBM bo aborts
//!   the Venus driver).
//! - One renderer; no driver-specific skip paths inside the bo
//!   constructor.
