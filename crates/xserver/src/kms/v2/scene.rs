//! `SceneCompositor` — composed output pass (Stage 2d MVP).
//!
//! Per rendering-model-v2 spec § "SceneCompositor" and Stage 2
//! plan substage 2d. Owns the blit pipeline (reuses v1's
//! `CompositorPipeline` — same shaders, same descriptor layout,
//! same sampler), per-output descriptor-pool rings, the
//! scene-structure dirty flag, and the per-output pending-ack
//! queues that thread snapshot/ack through the I6b page-flip
//! retirement path.
//!
//! Stage 2d MVP scope:
//!
//! - **Full-redraw every tick.** Buffer-age clipping is Stage 2e.
//!   Stage 2d still records the damage snapshots so 2e is a
//!   smaller diff, but the actual compose draws every scene
//!   entry every frame.
//! - **Single-output preferred.** The code loops over all
//!   outputs, but only the single-output xfce-on-bee path is
//!   exercised. Multi-output flip ordering is risk-listed in
//!   the Stage 2 plan (Risk 20).
//! - **No HW cursor plane.** Per I7 the cursor parks; Stage 5
//!   reintroduces it as a SceneCompositor strategy choice. For
//!   Stage 2d the cursor is skipped from the scene entirely —
//!   cursor rendering needs a small cursor pixmap which Stage 3
//!   will allocate alongside `create_cursor` wiring.
//! - **Manual-redirected windows skipped automatically.** Manual
//!   redirect flips the window to `scene_participating = false`;
//!   the scene walk prunes that window's subtree. The compositor
//!   reintroduces those pixels by painting its output/COW surface.
//! - **bg_pixel only.** Root background is the
//!   `vkCmdBeginRendering` clear color; `bg_pixmap` (which
//!   needs a sample-from-pixmap into root) waits for Stage 3.
//!
//! Compose flow (per [`SceneCompositor::tick`] call):
//!
//! 1. For each output, if `acquire_scanout_bo` returns `None`
//!    (all BOs in flight), skip — next core-loop iteration retries.
//! 2. Walk `core.top_level_order`, look up each window's
//!    drawable in `store`, build a `CompositeDraw` list.
//! 3. Peek presentation damage on each contributing drawable;
//!    record the snapshot keyed by drawable id for later ack.
//! 4. Call `kms::vk::compositor::record_and_present_composite`
//!    — records the compose CB into the scanout BO's
//!    pre-allocated `vk_transfer.command_buffer`, submits with
//!    `signalSemaphore = bo.vk_semaphore`, exports the sync_file
//!    fd, atomic-flips with explicit IN_FENCE_FD. v1's helper
//!    handles all of this; v2 just builds the scene + reuses
//!    the helper.
//! 5. Push a `PendingAck` onto the output's queue, advance
//!    `scene_structure_dirty = false`.
//!
//! [`SceneCompositor::handle_page_flip_complete`] then ack's
//! the captured snapshots after KMS retires the matching BO.
