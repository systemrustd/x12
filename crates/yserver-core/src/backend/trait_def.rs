//! `Backend` trait — the surface `process_request` and the core loop
//! call on the host backend. Exists primarily as a seam for testing
//! (`RecordingBackend` lives next door, gated `#[cfg(test)]`) and so
//! that the KMS backend can sit alongside the host-X11 backend without
//! touching every call site.
//!
//! Method signatures mirror the existing `HostX11Backend::*` methods
//! 1:1 — no `Param` structs, no parameter renaming. Several methods
//! still take raw `u32` host xids rather than handle newtypes — call
//! sites pass `u32` from the `ResourceTable`'s `host_xid` field, and
//! rewrapping/unwrapping at every call boundary is noise.
