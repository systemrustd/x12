//! State-borrowing key event fanout.
//!
//! KeyPress / KeyRelease delivery follows the X11 keyboard model: at
//! most one window receives the event (the active grab's window if a
//! grab is in effect, otherwise the focused window). The event is
//! emitted to subscribers with `KeyPressMask` / `KeyReleaseMask` on
//! that window. XI2 device-event subscribers on the same window also
//! receive a parallel XI2 KeyPress / KeyRelease.
//!
//! "Focus" comes from the per-client `ClientState::focused_window`.
//! In practice all clients share the same value (every `SetInputFocus`
//! mirrors it across clients), so the helper picks the first non-ROOT
//! focus it sees. When every client is rooted, the event is dropped.
