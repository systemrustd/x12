# Status

Tracks progress against the phases in [`high-level-design.md`](high-level-design.md).
Update as work lands.

## Phase 1 — Nested protocol core (in progress)

Goal: accept X11 clients on a Unix socket, complete setup/auth, implement
resource IDs, atoms, properties, windows, basic events, and errors. Run
`xeyes`, `xclock`, `xterm`, `xev`.

### Working

- Unix socket listener, per-client thread, setup handshake (little-endian
  clients only — by design).
- Per-client resource ID space (allocated via `IdAllocator`),
  server-global atom table with 68 predefined atoms, per-client
  event_masks per window.
- Property storage: `ChangeProperty`, `DeleteProperty`, `GetProperty`
  with cross-client `PropertyNotify` fanout.
- Window tree: `CreateWindow`, `DestroyWindow` (recursive), `MapWindow`,
  `UnmapWindow`, `ConfigureWindow`, `GetGeometry`, `QueryTree`,
  `ChangeWindowAttributes`, `GetWindowAttributes`.
- Drawing forwarded to host: `PolyLine`, `PolyArc`, `PolyFillArc`,
  `PolyRectangle`, `PolyFillRectangle`, `ClearArea`, `CopyArea`,
  `PutImage`, `ImageText8`, `ImageText16`, `PolyText8`.
- GC lifecycle/state: `CreateGC`, `ChangeGC`, `FreeGC`,
  `SetClipRectangles`.
- Pixmap/cursor lifecycle (allocation only).
- Events emitted: `Expose`, `MapNotify`, `ConfigureNotify`, `KeyPress`,
  `KeyRelease`, `FocusIn`, `FocusOut`, `PropertyNotify`,
  `DestroyNotify`, `UnmapNotify` (cross-client subscriber fanout via
  per-window event masks).
- Keyboard forwarding from the host window to the focused nested client.
- `xeyes`, `xclock`, and `xterm` come up; `xterm` accepts input.

### Pending — Phase 1 punch list

In rough priority order:

- [x] **Real font metrics in `QueryFont`.** `OpenFont` now opens the
      same font on the host server, issues `QueryFont`, and caches the
      full `FontMetrics` (header + properties + per-glyph `CharInfo`).
      `QueryFont` replies with the cached data. `FONTABLE` resolution
      handles both Font and GC ids (GC carries a `font` attribute).
- [x] **`QueryTextExtents` (opcode 48).** Computed locally from the
      cached `CharInfo` array — no host round trip per call.
- [x] **`ListFonts` / `ListFontsWithInfo` (opcode 49 / 50).** Proxied
      to the host. `ListFontsWithInfo` forwards each per-font reply
      until the trailing sentinel reply.
- [x] **Property storage.** Real per-window property storage with
      `ChangeProperty` / `DeleteProperty` / `GetProperty` and
      cross-client `PropertyNotify` fanout via per-(client, window)
      event masks.
- [x] **`UnmapNotify`.** Fired on every mapped → unmapped transition,
      both explicit (`UnmapWindow`) and implicit (`DestroyWindow` and
      client-disconnect cleanup). Cross-client subscriber fanout via
      the same per-(client, window) event masks; root window is
      protected from unmap inside `ResourceTable::unmap_window`.
- [x] **Lifecycle / WM events.** `ReparentWindow` now updates the
      resource tree and emits `ReparentNotify`. `SendEvent` supports
      synthetic `ClientMessage` delivery for the Phase 1 route.
      (`DestroyNotify` and `UnmapNotify` already shipped.) Design:
      [`2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding-design.md).
      Plan:
      [`2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding.md).
- [x] **Per-window clipping in the ynest backend.** Each nested
      top-level now gets its own host subwindow; drawing is routed via
      `top_level_host_target`. Child-window drawing now applies
      accumulated host offsets for the existing host-routed drawing
      paths.
- [x] **Pointer events.** `ButtonPress` / `ButtonRelease`,
      `MotionNotify`, `EnterNotify` / `LeaveNotify` delivered via
      `HostInputPump` + `xid_map` fanout. `xeyes` now tracks cursor
      via real `MotionNotify` events.
- [x] **`CopyArea` and `PutImage`.** Phase 1 supports `ZPixmap` into
      host-backed windows and pixmaps; host-backed pixmaps created for
      depths 1, 24, and 32. `CopyArea` handles host-backed
      window/window, pixmap/window, window/pixmap, and pixmap/pixmap
      copies with drawable-depth validation. `XYBitmap`/`XYPixmap`
      remain follow-ups.
- [x] **xterm redraw requests observed so far.** Added forwarding for
      `PolyRectangle` and `ImageText16`, plus per-GC
      `SetClipRectangles` storage and host application. These removed
      the unsupported/stubbed requests seen in scrollback logs.

### Known follow-ups

Small items already identified during recent work, captured here so
they don't get lost. Not yet sized into punch-list bullets; mostly
contingent on landed work.

Consolidated design:
[`2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding-design.md).
Implementation plan:
[`2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-phase1-outstanding.md).

- **`UnmapNotify.from_configure = true`.** Encoder accepts the byte
  for wire correctness; every call site currently passes `false`. The
  `true` path fires when a parent's `ConfigureWindow` shrinks a child
  out of view. Wire it once we track parent-resize-driven implicit
  unmaps.
- **Broader `SendEvent` event types.** Opcode 25 currently supports
  synthetic `ClientMessage`, which is the Phase 1/ICCCM-critical path.
  Other synthetic core events remain unsupported until a real client
  requires them.
- **Handler-level integration tests for opcode 10 / opcode 4 fanout.**
  Today only the encoder, the `subscribers()` snapshot, and the
  `ResourceTable` state machine are unit-tested; a true
  request → fanout → wire-bytes test would require driving
  `handle_request` against mock writers. Deferred — spec already
  notes the gap.
- **xterm scrollback.** `seq 1 200` scrolls forward cleanly via
  `CopyArea`, and xterm otherwise renders/accepts input. Scrollback via
  scrollbar, mouse wheel, PageUp, and Shift+PageUp still does not behave
  correctly after implementing `ImageText16`, `PolyRectangle`, and
  `SetClipRectangles`. Latest logs show no unsupported opcodes on the
  tested path, so this is parked for now; next investigation should
  focus on xterm input semantics, scrollbar state/grabs, or a subtler
  copy/clip coordinate mismatch rather than a plainly missing opcode.

### Out of scope for Phase 1

- BIG-REQUESTS, MIT-SHM, RANDR, XKB, XFIXES, DAMAGE, COMPOSITE, SYNC,
  PRESENT, SHAPE, RENDER, XInput2, GLX. These are Phase 3+.
- Big-endian clients.
- Selections / clipboard (Phase 2).

## Phase 2 — Desktop semantics

Goal: ICCCM and EWMH behavior, selections, clipboard, focus, grabs,
configure requests, reparenting, override-redirect, root-window
properties. Run a simple WM (Openbox / i3 / awesome / fluxbox).

Not started. Blocked on Phase 1 property storage and lifecycle events.

## Phase 3 — Toolkit compatibility

Goal: extensions and behavior needed for GTK, Qt, SDL, GLFW, Electron.
Implement enough XKB, XInput2, RENDER, SHAPE, DAMAGE, COMPOSITE, SYNC,
and PRESENT for real applications.

Not started.

## Phase 4 — Accelerated clients

Goal: modern GLX/EGL/Vulkan direct-rendering paths, MIT-SHM, buffer
sharing. Validate real GPU-accelerated clients.

Not started.

## Phase 5 — Full desktop sessions

Goal: run Xfce, MATE, LXQt, and standalone WM sessions end to end.
Validate panels, launchers, notification daemons, clipboard managers,
screen lockers, global shortcuts, external compositors.

Not started.

## Phase 6 — Standalone DRM/KMS

Goal: replace the nested backend with a real backend on libinput, udev,
GBM, EGL/Vulkan, and atomic KMS. Hotplug, multi-monitor presentation,
session management, fullscreen / direct-scanout paths.

Not started. The `yserver` binary is a placeholder.

## Phase 7 — Security hardening

Goal: per-client capabilities, permission prompts or launch-time
configuration, dummy responses for unauthorized requests, an
Xorg-compatible compatibility mode.

Not started.
